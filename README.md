# ELO-Calculation-Test

An elo calculator that takes in .json files as an input and outputs a new .json file with the calculated data that was made for the THC discord server.

## Instructions

First, you should configure the config file to your liking, and note that an output file will be created if one doesn't exist on your configured directory.

Weight - A signed integer defining the volatility of the elo.

Mega - A boolean defining whether the game is a mega THC or not.

Draw - A boolean defining whether the game ended with a draw or not.

Ask for confirmation - A boolean that determines whether the console window will do anything besides updating the elo.

Input file - The directory of the participants input

Output file - The directory of the participants output
